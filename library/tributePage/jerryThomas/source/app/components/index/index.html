          <p class="t-subheading">
            <strong>Jeremiah "Jerry" P. Thomas (October 30, 1830 – December 15, 1885)</strong> was an American bartender
            who owned and operated saloons in New York City. Because of his pioneering work in popularizing cocktails
            across the United States as well, he is considered "the father of American mixology". In addition to writing
            the seminal work on cocktails, "The Bar-Tender's Guide" (alternately titled "How to Mix Drinks or The
            Bon-Vivant's Companion"), Thomas displayed creativity and showmanship while preparing drinks and established
            the image of the bartender as a creative professional. As such, he was often nicknamed the "Professor" Jerry
            Thomas.

              <span>Early life, education and work</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="t-body">
              Thomas was born about 1830 in Sackets Harbor, New York. As a young man, he learned bartending in New
              Haven, Connecticut before sailing for California during its mid-19th century Gold Rush. While in
              California, Thomas worked as a bartender, gold prospector and minstrel show manager. According to his 1885
              obituary, he was left some money by his father, which helped in these travels.
            </p>
            <p class="t-body">
              Thomas moved back to the East Coast in 1851, settling in New York City. He opened a saloon below Barnum's
              American Museum; it would be the first of four saloons he would run in New York City over his lifetime.
              After running this first bar, Thomas went on the road for several years, working as the head bartender at
              hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Charleston, South
              Carolina; and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a set of solid-silver
              bar tools. He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed elaborate and flashy
              techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers. He often wore flashy
              jewelry and had his bar tools and cups embellished with precious stones and metals. At the Occidental
              Hotel in San
              Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week—more than the Vice President of the United States.

              <span>The first "Bar-Tender's Guide"</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="t-body">
              In 1862, Thomas finished "Bar-Tender's Guide" (alternately titled "How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant's
              Companion"), the first drink book ever published in the United States. The book collected and codified
              what
              was then an oral tradition of recipes from the early days of cocktails, including some of his own
              creations;
              the guide laid down the principles for formulating mixed drinks of all categories. He would update it
              several times in his lifetime to include new drinks that he discovered or created. The first edition of
              the
              guide included the first written recipes of such cocktails as the Brandy Daisy, Fizz, Flip, Sour and
              variations of the earliest form of mixed drink, Punch. The 1876 edition included the first written recipes
              for the Tom Collins, which appeared just after The Tom Collins Hoax of 1874.

            </h3>
            <p class="t-body">
              Thomas developed his signature drink, the Blue Blazer, at the El Dorado gambling saloon in San Francisco.
              The drink is made by lighting whiskey afire and passing it back and forth between two mixing glasses,
              creating an arc of flame. Thomas continued to develop new drinks throughout his life. His mixing of the
              Martinez", which recipe was published in the 1887 edition of his guide, has sometimes been viewed as a
              precursor to the modern martini. Thomas claimed to have invented the Tom and Jerry and did much to
              popularize it in the United States; however, the history of the drink predated him.

            <p class="t-body">
              Upon returning to New York City, he became head bartender at the Metropolitan hotel. In 1866 he opened his
              own bar again, on Broadway between 21st and 22nd Streets, which became his most famous establishment.
              Thomas
              was one of the first to display the drawings of Thomas Nast. In his saloon he hung Nast's caricatures of
              the
              political and theatrical figures; one notable drawing, now lost, was of Thomas "in nine tippling postures
              colossally." The saloon included fun-house mirrors. This historic bar has been adapted for use as a
              Restoration Hardware store.
            </p>
            <p class="t-body">
              Thomas was an active man about town, a flashy dresser who was fond of kid gloves and his gold Parisian
              watch. He enjoyed going to bare-knuckle prize fights, and was an art collector. He enjoyed traveling. By
              middle age he was married and had two daughters. Always a good sport, at 205 pounds he was one of the
              lighter members of the Fat Men's Association. He had a side interest in gourds; at one point in the late
              1870s, Thomas served as president of The Gourd Club after producing the largest specimen.

            <p class="t-body">
              Toward the end of his life, Thomas tried speculating on Wall Street, but bad judgments rendered him broke.
              He had to sell his successful saloon and auction off his considerable art collection; he tried opening a
              new
              bar but was unable to maintain the level of popularity as his more famous location. He died in New York
              City
              of a stroke (apoplexy) in 1885 at the age of 55. His death was marked by substantial obituaries across the
              United States. The New York Times obituary noted that Thomas was "at one time better known to club men and
              men about town than any other bartender in this city, and he was very popular among all classes." He is
              interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.
